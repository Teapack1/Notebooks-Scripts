People have built buildings inside of which there are heavy things that you pay to have access to so that you can go in and lift these heavy things up and then put them down in the same place. And it's called a gym. We've had to artificially create discomfort in our own lives because it's been completely eroded from our normal existence.

I get to the end of my twenties, I've achieved success in many of the ways that society tells a young man that he should value success. There was a discordance, something fell off. You then think, maybe I need to assess whether or not the things that I've been told I should want are things that I actually want to want. It feels like a quarter-life crisis. I think so many men go through this. ",Men Turning 30 Hit Their Manopause | Jordan Peterson,0,50469
user,"Outsourcing your sense of self-worth to the crowd is unbelievably dangerous. Not only will you begin to change how you act to fit in with the expectations of everyone else, you sometimes lose who you really are in the process. Schopenhauer said, other places' heads are a wretched place to be the home of a man's true happiness. This manipulation of who you are, honestly, of showing up in a way that's performative so that other people will like you, or you think that they will, means that the best you can hope for is for people to fall in love with the projection. And ultimately, what may end up happening is that you now need to play up to a role which you do not resonate with. And if you start to deviate from that, even if you're not a content creator, that deviation is going to feel disingenuous, even though it is you moving toward a more genuine version of you.

I spend time on and put out most of my content on social media. And in addition to that, the lights are too bright at night and they're not getting enough sunlight during the day. An important thing to understand about our circadian system and health is that in the morning and throughout the day, your eyes are less sensitive to light and you need more of it in order to get what you need. And at night, your eyes are far more sensitive to artificial lighting and you need far less of it in order to disrupt your circadian system in bad ways, disrupt your mental health. Now, does that mean you have to walk around with sunglasses at night and dim all the lights in your house? Well, no, but you could afford to dim them a little bit. You could afford to switch to the red light function on your phone. It's amazing when you start to think about how most people exist now.

Anytime you alter your words or behaviour to fit someone else's needs rather than your own, anytime you lie about your interests, hobbies or background, anytime you pursue a goal to impress others rather than fulfil yourself, that is needy. Whereas most people focus on what behaviour is attractive or unattractive, what determines neediness and therefore attractiveness is the why behind your behaviour. You can say the coolest thing or do what everyone else does, but if you do it for the wrong reason it will come off as needy and desperate and turn people off.

Resistance training has an interesting property that I haven't heard discussed before. that pertains to men and women who do it, which is unlike cardiovascular training. During resistance training bout, because of the blood flow to the muscle, the so-called pump, you get a little window into what the potential progress would look like. That pump dissipates post-workout, and then if you allow sufficient rest and nutrition, et cetera, you'll get a hypertrophy response. And so I would say for anyone who's worried about getting too big, unless your pump is bigger than you want to be, you're not gonna get that.

Rats and rodents of all kinds love running on treadmills. There's something rewarding about it for them, but in any event, it lowers their blood pressure, it leads to improvements in a number of metrics that you expect. And you see the same thing in humans who run on a treadmill or run outdoors or swim in cardiovascular exercise. And I love to talk about an experiment where they took two different cages with animals. One is running voluntarily, but then that running wheel is tethered to a running wheel in another cage that encloses an animal, forces it to run every time the other one runs. So forced exercise versus voluntary exercise. And the takeaway is very straightforward. Voluntary exercise leads to all sorts of improvements in health metrics, resting heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, resting blood glucose, et cetera. The animal that's forced exercise, you see the opposite. So it's not exercise per se, it's something about being forced to exercise causes decrements in a number of health metrics.

It's precisely Monk Mode's reliable effectiveness creates a problem because the dark side is that addictive lifestyle thing. Monk mode justifies a retreat from life and risk and self-adventure. It justifies it as self-development and it makes you feel noble in isolation, so much so that it can become hard to bring yourself back out. And this means that if you already have a tendency to live a sheltered, slightly unsocial life, you're encouraging yourself to further abscond away from ever building a real-life support network, which is ultimately the thing you need the most in the long run.

I'd noticed that there's a trend of people who've made it explaining how work-life balance is actually what's most important and how you can't be powered by resentment or a sense of insufficiency. And it's a failure, I think, on the part of the guru to understand that the tools you need to get from nought to fifty and not the same that you need to get from ninety to ninety-five. It's also a basic failure of memory. When you look at what got that person to where they are, it's precisely the traits that they're now castigating. Almost everybody has more pain and resentment and fear in the beginning. which is why they all use it. And once you've achieved enough success and validation from the world to not be fueled by that anymore, that's great. That doesn't mean that people who are just starting out can achieve the success that you now have by using strategies which you only access after becoming successful.

Typically, people who are competent in looking for that same thing in a partner, they focus on bettering themselves before they focus on looking for another. A human who's like, I really just want to be with somebody. I want to be with somebody. I'm ready. How do I find my person? Get that energy out of your life as both a woman, which I can speak more to, and a man, and instead become somebody worth finding. And that's really hard to hear. But when you start working out, which doesn't mean you have to be perfectly fit, but you have more energy, when you start pursuing something that you're uniquely interested in, you're more interesting, and thus you will attract more interesting people. I think one of the worst things we've ever done is allow dating apps to enter into our dating equation. We have thought that it is a numbers game of finding the right person as opposed to becoming the right person. When you become the right person, you will attract people continuously no matter what.

user,"a psychology explanation for why menopause exists. It's called the grandmother hypothesis. Grandmother hypothesis says that why would you have female animal that exists beyond their reproductive window? If our goal is to survive and reproduce, as soon as you stop reproducing, surely kicking the bucket makes a ton of sense, because get out of the way, let the calories go to the ones that are going to be able to survive if you can no longer make kids. But that doesn't account for the fact that the very effortful rearing that's required for human children. If you imagine that you have a particular fertility window, after that point, you as grandmother can no longer produce children that sap calories, but can contribute to the rearing of children, not only yours, but your daughter's and your sister's and so on and so forth. You age out of your reproductive role and move into a new kind of role. So you are still a net positive from a caloric perspective to the whole tribe. ",Why Menopause Exists | Codie Sanchez,0,54314

user,"Here's what I really say about body count. The testament of your body count is more your rejection rate than how many people you slept with. Let's take somebody like you for example who's got a big name on social media, looks great, access to loads of women through the nightclub. Now if your body count is, let's say if it's ten, but you've had hundreds of girls throwing themselves at you, yours is actually still low. Whereas if another guy who has no access to women but finally gets one or two girls to sleep with him, on paper it might be less, but his rejection rate is so low. So really look at how many people your partner is rejecting rather than just their body count. Because on paper, a really unattractive man who has nothing going for him, his body count's going to be low, doesn't mean he's a decent man. It's just that he didn't have the opportunity. Similarly, women that are not that nice to be around, not that kind, not that pretty, not that attractive, hers is going to be low. Doesn't mean she's virtuous. It's just that she didn't have access. It's the ones that have access, but choose to be selective. That's what you should be looking at, is their selectivity. ",What Does Your Body Count Really Mean? | Sadia Khan,140,50856

Survivor guilt, someone goes away to war, all of their friends die, you get to come home and there's a very specific type of guilt that's associated with that which is his belief that he should have gone with his friends. He was talking to me that as he begins to pull himself away from these beliefs and insights and lifestyles that no longer serve him, he was starting to feel this degree of guilt for leaving his friends behind.

And there's like a fifteen percent flat tax in Hungary. What did that do to their birthright? It increased it from the late nineteen nineties throughout the twenty tens. The total fertility rate was one point three. So it remained stagnant and flat. Orban comes into power in two thousand and ten or two thousand eleven, Fidesz wins, and these policies were implemented in twenty fifteen. In two thousand and ten, when Orban was in power, the fertility rate in Hungary is one point three. Now in twenty twenty three, the fertility rate is one point five four. It hasn't had a massive increase, but it's had had an increase. So we had twenty years of stagnation and all of a sudden these policies are implemented and you see a growth in the fertility rate.

user,"Women, when they have children, actually prioritize the children first and foremost. One of the priorities is becoming then super cautious of the man that she allows to enter into the man's world. If she's a really good mother, she tends to keep a good co-parenting relationship with the ex, and a lot of men don't feel comfortable with that. But the true good woman, like the single mum that you should be looking for, is the one that's got a good relationship with her ex-husband. What men do is they prefer the woman that has no contact with the ex and the kids have never seen the ex. And they think, oh, I'll go for that girl. At least their baby father's not around. That's a signal that she deprives or prevents children from connecting with their father. That's not a good thing. That's not a green flag. That's actually a red flag. So what men are doing is sometimes they're selecting women and thinking she's got children, but she doesn't let the kids see their dad and they're not in his life and he was a bum. But what does that tell you about her selection process? And what does that tell you about her ability to co-parent? It's an insight into what would happen if you two broke up.

Now my experience of working with women that go for these age gap relationships is they are in survival mode without a father. They need that safety and comfort. And the conversations that we normally find really boring coming from our father about mortgage rates and saving your money, they sexualize those conversations. So when they hear it from an older man, they're like, oh, no, he's so responsible. So they end up initially going for that older man and falling in love. But once they feel safe and they've got the money and they've got the safety, they then look for men around their own age.

user,"Talk to me about the problem with nice guys. Essentially what nice guys do is what they suffer with is not that they're too nice or anything, it's just that they have incredibly weak boundaries when it comes to women. What they do is they blame the fact that they're so nice as to why they can't get women. But it's not about being nice, it's about a lack of masculinity. One of the best ways to establish masculinity is placing boundaries when you don't like a behavior. You don't roll over and allow it to continue and then give her more in order for you to get her. You set a boundary and you have a willingness to walk away. Nice guys, what happens is they don't like to exert their boundaries and they don't have a willingness to walk away. So what ends up happening is their nice nature becomes a reason for resentment because women don't like it. They actually feel angry. when you're too nice to them because then they don't feel protected. They feel like you're weak because you'll feel like she has to raise you and she'll lose respect for you. What we truly want is who we can trust makes good decisions but the one that doesn't trust his own decision-making and we have to do it and he comes across as being nice, essentially he's seen as weak.

An example of that is people who are in their head a lot. What I learned from this was a very simple thing. I want to be happy, like many people do, but I did something that most people don't do, which is try to figure out how the hell do you actually be happy? And one of the things about actually being happy is that you need to get out of your head. Most people who are, again, the type of people who listen to podcasts, they are in their head. They try to think their way through life. They think their way through problems and that serves them. But then they think they can think their way through feeling. That's not how emotion works. I thought if you think a certain thing, you will feel a certain way, which will lead you to do a certain thing. If I think that this person just cut me off while I was driving, I will feel pissed. I'll feel angry. And I will then do something in retaliation. I thought it's a one-way street. Then I realized like math equations and math equations are reversible.

I think often in life, whether it's marketing or innovation, when we're building companies or products or making content, we fall into the trap of thinking that the thing we're creating in and of itself is doing all of the work to tell the story. But when I looked at tons of studies, when I looked at apples and art galleries, it's so clear that much of the work is being done in psychology, not in reality. If we just think about the Apple store, every electronic store you've ever walked into in your life is kind of like a crazy jungle of wires, right? That's how electronic stores always were. What Apple did differently was they gave the iPhone space in the shop. So the space that the object is given actually pours into the value of the object itself. Because it has two feet either side of it, the frame in which it's presented is telling you that this item in the middle is high value. The context you've always seen that kind of framing in is an art gallery. The other thing I think is so critical is they only show you one of each device and they keep the rest in the back room. If we think about scarcity creating value, the frame in which you present something is doing so much of the work to communicate the value of the thing within it.

It feels far-fetched to me that it's that high, and this is why I think it's both reflecting. Economics might have gotten us to this situation, but now in a lot of these communities, for a lot of these groups, these norms have been broken. And so people maybe have a higher bar for marriage than having a child with somebody. Maybe they're like, yeah, this is an acceptable thing for us not to be married, for us to be living apart, for us to have this kid.

Steve Jobs had some quote, the storyteller is the most powerful person on earth because they get everybody else to take action. So they're the ones who move one person to the next. And this is how politicians get people, but you're very rarely taught how to tell a story. nobody really knows how to articulate it. You're not taught this in school.

Classic trope here is like you see like a dad come home from work. They sort of slump through the door.

assistant,"Absolutely legit. There's one thing I will tell a father after birth is put that baby on your chest. The reason for that is human babies are sensory beings like a lot of little baby mammals. Their senses are very heightened. One of the senses that's not heightened is vision. But they are amazing at smelling, they're amazing at feeling and touch. So if you put them on your chest as a father, first of all, they smell you and they start to smell who you are because they can't really see you. Secondly, a wonderful thing called bio-behavioral synchrony happens. When you put a baby on your chest, their physiology starts to go into time with your physiology, so they'll come to the same temperature as you. Their heart rate will come to the same heart rate as you. Their blood pressure will come to the same blood pressure as you. Also, touch is the key releaser of bonding hormones, oxytocin, dopamine, beta endorphin. If you want to release those, the best thing you can do is use touch. And it's really critical as the first interaction between a father and child. ",Why Children Must Lie On Their Father's Chest After Birth,7612,54106

So as a parent, you need to be very good at risk detection. You need to look out for those risks to your brain. The second really big ones are in the outer areas of the brain. So we see the areas related to empathy, increase in size, which again is obvious. You need to be very good at reading your child's emotional needs, what their emotional state is, what they're going to need. And particularly when all you've got is somebody screaming at you, you need to be very good at that. The other thing is all those really good parenting skills like attention and planning and problem solving and organizing. So those areas of the brain associated with that related to executive function, they also increase in size.

That's just something that I've discovered for myself, so a lot of the time I will do those things late at night. When I'm working with someone I'm always asking them, when do you feel like you're most focused. Most people will say in the mornings, that's great for you. Go do it early in the morning. But it's not that way for everybody. If you know that you love working at night, go work at night. I always laugh at people who tell me they get up at five a.m. and that's the only way to like live their life. I'm like, if you want to wake up at five a.m., like go for it.

user,"The biggest study ever on the pay gap, I think it was done by Harvard, basically looked at Uber drivers in America. The big reason is the biggest because they had so much data. Uber obviously has so much data and men and women both drive Ubers in America. They looked at the paying and they were like, well, women are getting paid less at Uber. How does that make sense? Because it's obviously all automated. So what a great way of studying male and female behaviour to work out what is in this gap. And there's three things in the gap. The first was men drove at different times of night. So men would do the graveyard shifts early mornings where you're getting paid more. They would want to do that. Women less so. The second was that men were more likely to stick with the platform for longer. so they had more experiences and they benefited from that experience. Makes sense of any job. And the third reason, which is fifty percent of the gap, was that men just drive faster. Just drive a little faster guys, then you'll close that gap. That shows it wasn't discrimination that's causing the pay gap in Uber. It was just heavy right foot, different types of behavior. And I guess we can have a discussion of what shapes that behavior. But we need to start that conversation with. it's not discrimination, at least in Uber, different types of behavior. ",Why Is There An Uber Pay Gap Between Men And Women?,60,52986
user,"I wrote this essay called, Is Optimism a Scam? The pure thesis behind it was, what you had twenty years ago was the secret, the book that came out. It was this idea that you could just manifest things into reality. And the cynical, skeptical crowd completely destroyed the idea. There's three great examples of the secret. Winston Churchill, when he was nineteen years old, saying, one day this great city will be under attack. I will be the one that saves it. Forty, fifty years before World War II. You have Arnold Schwarzenegger saying, I will become the greatest bodybuilder ever and the greatest movie star at the time. John Rockefeller as well, which is one day I will be the richest man in the world. He said that to his bank teller who like rejected him for a bank. So that's the kind of bull case for like ridiculous affirmations that manifest reality. But the problem with that is for every Rockefeller, Schwarzenegger, Churchill, there's ten thousand delusional that say these things. And the problem that the optimism crowd has, it's a marketing problem. They've oversold it.

Every time I speak to a dad who's fighting for his child, that is the most heartbreaking story I'll hear. I'll just ask any parent, like, what's the one thing you don't want to lose? And I'd say like, nine times out of ten, they'll say my child. And when you consider how many men are losing their child in a system that is corrupt, I feel like that's a bigger issue than we pretend is. And not just family courts, but men are discriminated against in many areas of criminal court. Like I know there's been some interesting research by Professor Sandra Starr, and she found that women are twice as likely to avoid prison for the same crime. And if they are sentenced, men will get a sixty three percent longer sentence. That's in America. Again, for the same crime, same criminal history, there is a sentencing bias against black Americans, ten percent is found. So if you're black in America, you'll get ten percent longer. Men get sixty three percent longer. And if you're a black man, it's sixty three plus ten percent. So you've got the compounding of the problem itself.

Maybe he has vulnerabilities that can be exploited. One of the things that this psychologist points out, Henry Murray, he writes this report saying that Hitler has a large feminine component to his personality. Stanley level reads this report and he wants to figure out a way to use this to the advantage of the United States. Stanley level comes up with the idea that what if we inject females hormones into the vegetables that Hitler eats? if he eats these hormones then that's really gonna push him over the edge and his chest is going to grow breasts. this will decimate his fragile ego and he's gonna lose all of his credibility and will somehow win the war. Stanley level in his memoir, he says that he got some of these female hormones. He was able to give it to a gardener in Germany who supplied the Eagle's nest with its vegetables where Hitler kind of frequently went. And so Stanley level said, yeah, we got the sex hormones to this person, but we never knew really what happened to it. Apparently it didn't go through.

assistant,"When you have a developing brain, adding a substance to it makes us more vulnerable to it long term. When you use marijuana at a young age, it actually alters how your dopamine circuitry is formed and leaves you vulnerable to other addictions. Pornography has some similar neuroscientific mechanism where something is going on. People are prepubescent usually when they're exposed, which means that they don't get aroused, usually. They don't even understand what they're seeing, which is the most common thing when I talk to people who are addicted to pornography. But we do know that adding stuff to the developing brain, whether it's a particular kind of stimulus, let's say like abusive parents, or a substance alters its formation and that those effects are not quite permanent but sticky and then require some time to be rewired. Probably it has something to do with the way that our dopamine circuitry, our emotional circuitry, those things kind of get laid down.

That suggests that there is a pre-existing wound, something's happened before you came along. that's made them hypersensitive about the situation and their response is disproportionate. So whenever somebody's response is disproportionate to the scenario, there's potentially a wound. For me personally, all the holistic kind of things don't necessarily work on me. For me, the only way to outdo trauma is to make better decisions in life. Your trauma is kind of going to be always leading you to self-destructive paths. Your trauma is going to teach you to live for today and not worry about tomorrow. It's going to tell you to just indulge.

There's a research that did a multivariate regression analysis on people addicted. Which means they looked at which variable associates the most with usage.

And so oftentimes if you kind of think about it at night, a couple of things happen. The night is the only time you're with yourself. And I guarantee you the people who are getting motivated are not sitting there doom scrolling on their phone until they pass out. They're usually like sitting down quietly or something like that. Like what happens is you doom scroll, you get tired, you put the phone away, you put your head on the pillow, you don't fall asleep, and then you start having all these ideas. And there are studies that show that meditation improves creativity and things like that. Why is that? It's because you're with yourself. So that's one reason.

user,"Freedivers, it is a very dangerous sport because for most people, when carbon dioxide levels increase in the bloodstream and brain triggers this gas reflex, what freedivers train is carbon dioxide tolerance. So one way is you can do what's called cyclic hyperventilation. You do that, twenty-five times or so, and you think, oh, you're bringing a lot of oxygen. You are, but you're also offloading a lot of carbon dioxide, especially if you use forceful exhales. And then if you were to hold your breath, what you would find is you could hold your breath for a lot longer. Why? Because your carbon dioxide levels are reduced, so you don't have the same impulse to breathe. If you do that before going under water, but your carbon dioxide is then lower, you're going to be able to stay under longer. The way they die is they'll just be swimming, feeling completely calm because they've trained up the CO two tolerance.

People don't step on stage and some of these huge competitions and some of them are absolutely fine. Some of them have deep rooted mental issues, which is why they're putting their body through such trauma. And I think most of those people that are smart realize that they can only do that a certain amount of times before the risk becomes too high. So it's not just people that are overweight, it's people that are literally bulking up beyond all doubt and then die in themselves on the verge of starvation in order to win a competition. And the thing that concerns me is just the fact that I don't think we should be promoting the extremes in a way that suggests that they're healthy. I think there are certain elements where you can understand, admire, whatever you want to call it, the extremes. A friend or family member of mine was to get quite overweight. I wouldn't sit there and say that that's okay. I don't think everyone needs six-pack abs. Everyone doesn't need to be able to do that over three hundred kilos.

The higher that number is, the more oxygen your muscles can utilize, the more fit you are, the more capacity you have to avoid illness.

For example, it is very difficult to accurately quantify how many calories you're consuming. It doesn't matter how meticulous someone is with calorie counting. Calorie counting is nearly impossible to get perfectly accurately and often that's for reasons outside of your control. The nutritional information is allowed a natural variance. So just because something says it's a hundred calories doesn't mean it's a hundred. It might be a hundred and ten, it might be ninety. Also the way you prepare food for example can change the calorie content of that food or the energy content of that food. If you juice vegetables you can remove fiber.

If you now have to provide for first a wife and then kids, don't try and jump off that cliff and see if you don't die. Because if you leave behind some kids that aren't going to be able to fend for themselves, that's not good for your genetic line, right? If you don't have many married men and or men with kids, you have a greater increase in risk-taking behavior and testosterone. The problem that you have at the moment is we have the highest rates of sexlessness amongst young men I think ever in history. That's not good.

And in fact, I think if anything, it seems like there can be a positive aspect to competing with your male friends. There's just so much more overt interactions happening in male same-sex relationships, whereas for women's it seems to be a lot more kind of under the surface.

And so by regularly using antiseptic mouthwash, what you're doing is you're killing off bacteria that, among other things, are involved in the nitric oxide pathway, in your body. So when we consume fruits and vegetables that contain compounds called nitrates, the bacteria in our mouths reduce nitrite to nitrate, which is then what enters this nitric oxide pathway. And nitric oxide is a gas that we create in our blood vessels that increases blood flow, reduces blood pressure, You're basically negating your ability to derive a cardioprotective effect of healthy foods. And so they've done studies that have found obese participants that regularly used antiseptic mouthwash were at double the odds of developing hypertension and they saw a fifty percent increased risk of developing type two diabetes.

user,"Men who have gut fat are perceived to be better fathers. This is compared with the guy that's in good shape. And you think, hang on a second, how is the guy that isn't able to protect his family because he's less physically formidable going to be perceived as a better father? And the reason is that the guy who has more gut fat is seen to be less potentially attractive to other mates, which means that that if he is given one calorie, there is less likelihood of him spending that calorie on trying to acquire a new mate because more doors have been closed to him than the guy that is in good shape and may potentially have more doors open to him. I think that being less uncertain about your partner's strain contributes massively to a woman who might have anxious attachment or maybe there's a disparity in mate value there that she is going to feel a lot more comfortable with that. But the wild thing when you think about this is that comfort contributes quite a lot to woman's arousal.

That's terrifying. Please don't do this because you need the right proper medical staff around, but they're great experiments of having people breathe carbon dioxide directly. You basically panic. It turns out that there are a little group of neurons in the brainstem that respond to levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. Turns out the reason we breathe is of course to bring in oxygen and then offload carbon dioxide. But we don't have neurons that stimulate breathing for oxygen. We have neurons that sense when carbon dioxide levels get too high. So if you hold your breath, eventually carbon dioxide levels go up. And then at the moment that they reach a certain threshold, these neurons fire and trigger the gas reflex. So in that moment you bring in oxygen and then of course you offload some carbon dioxide.

So more recently, researchers have begun to explore the idea that women who are on hormonal birth control Given that it keeps your own estradiol levels very low, that this might be associated with a decreased preference for masculinity. There's been research showing that women who are on hormonal birth control prefer a less masculinized male face relative to what's preferred by the exact same women when they are naturally cycling. The men who were chosen by women when they were on hormonal birth control, those faces were seen as being less masculine and also sort of scored lower in terms of masculinity. using the objective measures relative to the faces of men who are chosen by naturally cycling women.

The super manly man, who only is entirely masculine in all his traits, he doesn't relate to women all that well. So it becomes a hit-the-middle problem.

user,Why would it matter to have male teachers in schools? ,Only 2% Of Kindergarten Teachers Are Men,20478,23259

One is because the evidence suggests that when there are male teachers in schools, especially in subjects like English, even in early years, the boys seem to do a bit better. And in the early years, there's some evidence that a bigger mix will be good for boys in the long run. But the other reason, I think, is that if we're trying to change gender stereotypes, there's a nice line from the women's movement, which is you have to see it to be it. If boys don't see any men in any of those roles, then it's not surprising that it's tough to get men to think about changing their lives so that they feel more of those roles.

One of the interesting things about kissing is in mouth-to-mouth kissing, I mean, not all cultures do it, so it doesn't necessarily work everywhere, but it seems that it's as close to universal as anything might be in large numbers of cultures. The key to it is you're exchanging information on essentially your immune system. So it's reckoned a five minute kiss results in the transmission from one person to the other of tens of billions of bacteria and all sorts of other things that belong to your inside to the other person. And it's giving them a very direct measure of the quality of your immune system. So if you think about falling in love, courtship, in other words, as a process of assessment.

There are more young women with a college degree than young men in both the UK and the US. On pretty much every measure you can look at, girls are ahead of boys. In most places now, the girls and women have caught up in math and science as well, and in some cases overtaken, and still have this huge lead in literacy and English. It's really interesting to go back and you read the stuff in the seventies when we were really pushing for gender equality in education to get more women into college and especially into more male-dominated subjects. And everybody was pushing for its parity. Nobody predicted once girls and women caught up with boys and men that they would keep going and that we would now have a bigger gender gap in higher education than we did fifty years ago just the other way around and can only be the result of structural factors.

user,"It's one thing to get what you want, but it's another thing to want what's worth getting. That's from Shane Parish. The danger of not spending time working out what you want to want can cause you to move in the wrong direction. Kyle Eschenroder explains it so well. Blindly following your desires makes you a slave to your impulses. the advertisements you're exposed to, and the confused chemical signals of your body. If we don't pause and ask ourselves what we want to want, we will spend our lives focused on unhealthy aims defined for us by others in the worst parts of ourselves. If we don't cut to the core and program our wants, then our best case scenario is to be a rich, famous, or successful slave. In short, your default factory settings are shit. Don't follow them. The people who do this are never going to fully actualize their potential, either for happiness or for success. What you want is to be able to arrive at a place where the things that you want are the things that you want to want. And that's why desires are important. So yes, a life should be lived by design, not default. ",Figure Out What You Want To Want,0,57924

You will see regularly people and guys that are charismatic, funny, sexy in person batting way outside of their league if you were to just look at them from an online perspective.

This press dude in an interview asked, what are you going to do differently this time that you didn't do last time when he's about to fight Aldo? And he says, I'm going to take it all in, because he was so preoccupied, fearful, in the zone, and doing the things that facilitated his performance, that he didn't actually get to experience what he was going through.

It was an initiative by the Australian government, I think, to try and improve men's mental health.

user,"how to decide between the multiplicity of options we all have in our lives. There are more things I can do with my time than time I have to do them in. How do I choose? And this is from Naval. If I'm faced with a difficult choice such as, should I marry this person? Should I take this job? Should I buy this house? Should I move to the city? Should I go into business with this person? If you cannot decide, the answer is no. The reason is modern society is full of options. So this is an interesting reframe to the paradox of choice. Yes, there are lots of things that you can do with your time. There are an unlimited number of options. This can make it hard to decide on which option to choose, but it also reduces the pressure of all decisions. If something isn't an obvious slam dunk yes, then it's likely a better option will come along soon. As Derek Sivers says, if it isn't a hell yeah, it's a no.
